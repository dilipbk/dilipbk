### 🧠 About Me (aka “The Origin Story”)

Once upon a semicolon, I was just a curious student. Now I’m a **6+ year battle-hardened software engineer** who’s scaled platforms to 5M+ users, optimized for sub-500ms load times, and still finds time to debug CSS like a philosopher.

I write code in:
- `TypeScript` because it's sane
- `Rust` because it's cool
- `JavaScript` because... well, the world runs on it

### 🧬 Currently Cooking

- Side-projects in `Rust` — it's strict, but I like the discipline
- A design system that doesn’t look like every other one
- How to reduce meetings without reducing pay 🤔

### 💬 Let's Get Awkwardly Professional

If you’re into:
- Shipping fast (but testing first, promise)
- Scaling systems without losing your soul
- Dark humor and darker themes

Then we’ll get along just fine.  
Shoot me a message, or don't. I’ll just be over here refactoring my life.
